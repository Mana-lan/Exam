# Basic git commands

## stage all changes in the actual repository
git add file 1

## current status of the working directory and stating area
git status
### It's a crucial tool for understanding what has been changed, what is staged for the next commit, and what is not yet tracked by Git.

## The git commit command is used to save changes from the staging area to the local repository.
git commit -m "Something interesting"
### This command is a key part of the version control process in Git, as it creates a new commit (or snapshot) in your repositoryâ€™s history with a unique identifier. Each commit records a set of changes to the files in your project and includes a commit message that describes the changes.

## The git push command is used to upload your local commits to a remote repository
git push
.
